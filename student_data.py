Descriptions: 
This file consists of student data management and input and export file logic.

For input_data() function: it is used to ask for a txt file that contains students information.
For get_data() function: it is used to extract dictionary from student data pickle file.
For numOfDays() function: it is used to get the difference between two days.
For days_for_isolation() function: it is used to calculate how many days the student has isolated.
For save_data() function: it is used to save dictionary to pickle file.
For export_daily_log_file() function: it is used to export the daily log file.
For export_data() function: it is used to export the file.
